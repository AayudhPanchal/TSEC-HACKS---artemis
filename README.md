# Wildlife Protection & Incident Reporting Platform

## 📌 Overview
This platform is designed to bridge the gap between tourists, locals, and NGOs to ensure faster responses to wildlife threats. It allows users to report incidents such as wildfires, poaching, and animal distress while providing NGOs with tools for coordination and wildlife monitoring.

## 🛠 Problem Statement
Wildlife conservation efforts are often hindered by slow response times, lack of coordination, and inefficient communication between tourists, locals, NGOs, and authorities. 

A **unified platform** can bridge this gap by enabling:
- **Tourists** to report smoke, fire, and unusual wildlife behavior in real time.
- **Locals** to alert authorities about potential poachers and threats.
- **NGOs** to coordinate conservation efforts efficiently across large areas, ensuring rapid response and better protection for endangered ecosystems.
